									Several teams were planning an EHR integration project. Timelines and budgets were being established and similar questions were coming up in weekly meetings. Project managers 
									stored the project details in a SharePoint site library and granted access to the teams. However, the site wasn't being used. In hopes of making the information more accessible, I made a quick 
									copilot agent to answer any questions about the project.
						
				
								
								</p>

								<p>
									<h2>Knowledge</h2>
									The base knowledge for the agent is the SharePoint site's document library. It holds a few word documents and excel file with project information.
									The settings are set to allow for generative AI to better respond to requests, but the AI's general knowledge option is turned off. I found that the general
									knowledge AI wasn't necessary for this project as the preference was to lean only on internal information. Side note: At the time of this post, the generative AI feature is in preview mode, so it likely wouldn't be appropriate
									for any externally-facing agents.
									<br> 
									<br>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bot1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								
								</p>

								<p>
						
									I set a couple topics to trigger for more frequently asked questions, like project cost, start date and assigned staff.
									<br> 
									<br>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bot5.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								
								</p>

					

								<p>
									<h2>Teams integration</h2>
									Authentication was required for this particular agent since the data was internal/sensitive. Microsoft appears to currently only allow for 
									Teams integrations for Microsoft-authenticated agents. The agent appears alongside other teams and chats in the Teams application. It operates similarly
									to any other conversations.
									<br>
									<br>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bot3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								
								</p>

								<p>
					
									Here you can see the topic set earlier spitting out a few FAQ options. The user can select them and there is a predefined response (as opposed to scanning all the documents). These run faster since the answers are already "queued up".
									<br>
									
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bot6.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								
								</p>

								<p>
					
									After it gives an answer, it will confirm that the question was answered. The conversation can still be continued even if the user says their question has been answered.
									<br>
									
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bot7.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									
									At the bottom, it indicates the cost produced is AI-generated. The project cost had a predefined answer, but there was additional cost information the agent found in the documents.
									Because we enabled the Generative AI option, the agent used the predefined answer and added the other cost information found. In this case, we fed it the $2 million and the maintenance and user costs it found elsewhere on the SharePoint site.
