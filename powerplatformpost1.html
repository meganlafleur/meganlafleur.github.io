		Our team faced issues with processing approvals to grant access to local systems with sensitive data. 
		The existing process was for managers to email whoever they knew by word-of-mouth could grant system access. 
		The person would respond if the new system user was approved for system access and ask any follow-up questions about the specific 
		systems or system environments the user needed. Someone would then be emailed or messaged separately to grant the requested access, 
		then finally messaging the new user to notify them of their newly granted access. A team member would then manually save the related emails 
		into a SharePoint folder as documentation for audits. The team requested a front-end form interface with approval triggers. 
		The timeline was tight, so I opted for a Canvas Power App with a SharePoint List and Power Automate flows to consolidate the workflow.
		We already had access to the Power Platform through our enterprise Microsoft License, which made setup easy. The big downside was we did not have
		access to premium connectors (Oracle database) or dataverse.</p>
		<p>Here's a walkthrough of what the app looked like initially:</p>
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pp1.mov" alt="" /></span></div>
		<video controls="controls" width="800" height="600" name="Video Name">
			<source src="images/pp1.mov">
		  </video>

		
	<p>
		I ended up making a few cosmetic and branding changes later:

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/usermgmtapp1.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>
	<p>
		I also added a different progress bar and required data to be entered before the "next" button was available in the form.

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/usermgmtapp3.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>

	<p>
		Then we needed a way to know what type of employee was being granted access, so I added a toggle for full time employees and contractors.

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/usermgmtapp4.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>

	<p>
		On the backend, there's a list that has each team and the type of access the team usually requires. For example, the team that fields calls from providers to assist with 
		changes to their accounts in our systems require a level of access that gives them the ability to make edits. In contrast, someone who only pulls reports from our systems 
		has a lower level of read-only/report-only access. When a new request is submitted, those expected access levels will attach to the request. The security team member who completed the request
		will know what type of access to set. 

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/usermgmtapp5.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>

	<p>
		Managers also have the option to grant a lower staging area access for new hires, then grant production access later.

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/usermgmtapp6.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>

	<p>
		We facilitate access to several systems, and users can select as many as they need. Some selections
		will trigger additional approvals. For example, if a user requires database access, there's several additional approvals that will trigger
		so we can coordinate with out database admins for anew user setup.

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/usermgmtapp7.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>

	<p>
		One requested functionality was requiring justification. In the event of an audit, we would have justifications on file for each system user.

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/usermgmtapp9.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>

	<p>
		At the end of the form, the manager's signature will populate with their role and a timestamp. They have the option to either use the populated signature
		or to draw their signature. The timestamp signature saved to the backend as a string value and the drawn signature stored as an image.
		When the user hits submit, all form fields are patched to the SharePoint List in a new data row and placed in pending approval status.
		

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/usermgmtapp10.png" alt="" /></span></div>
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/usermgmtapp11.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	</p>

	<p>
		When a new row is added to the list, a Power Automate flow is triggered to request approval from our security team via email. 
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/flow1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/flow3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	</p>

	<p>
		The approval emails has a deep link with the ID of the new request row. The security team can click it and will be taken to the approval page.
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/flow4.png" alt="" /></span></div>
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/approvalpage.png" alt="" /></span></div>
		
	</p>

	<p>
		Once a request is approved, an email is triggered back to the original requester.
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/flow7.png" alt="" /></span></div>
		
	</p>

	<p>
		The approval email is automatically stored in a designated SharePoint folder in case of auditor request.
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/flow5.png" alt="" /></span></div>
		
	</p>

	<p>
		But what if someone leaves or no longer needs access? In that case, we can revoke access. Back in the app, there's a page where our security team
		can view all existing users and make edits.
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/revoke1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/revoke2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/revoke3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	</p>

	<p>
		An email will then come back to our team so someone can disassociate access.
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/flow2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	</p>

	<p>
		Last but not least, a flow runs every week to clear revoked users off our list and move them to an archive list.
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/flow9.png" alt="" /></span></div>
