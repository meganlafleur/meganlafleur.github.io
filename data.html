							<p>An operations team needed a more consistent way to track
								licensing costs for technical resources (Microsoft enterprise licenses, Adobe, etc.).
								They had several csv files listing users, the resources, and the costs. Their requirements were
								to consolidate the spending reports, balance them against the allocated budgets
								for each of the teams, and see when overspending was occurring. 
							</p>

							<p>Because report users had Power BI Pro licenses, this report was able
								to be developed with Power BI and used as a functional report (as opposed to static).

							<p>This project was focused on tracking KPIs for multiple teams who complete a program renewal process each year for their clients. They wanted to track what statuses client renewals were in, including how many had been completed. They also wanted to filter based on client regions. I used DAX studio to add a visual showing which filters were applied. 
								
							</p>
							<p>Most of the data here was extracted daily from 
								an excel file and stored in a SharePoint list that 
								was being modified as team members processed client 
								renewals. I also added to the model an Oracle table 
								holding specific region information and joined it to 
								existing data using a unique client identifier. In this case, 
								we also wanted to be able to filter by all regions (of Texas) 
								and local health departments. To do this, I created a hierarchy 
								of regions and local health departments within each to allow 
								users to select specific areas.

								Unfortanately, the quality of the dashboard recording refused to cooperate at the time
								of this posting, so I'm crossing my fingers that all the figures aren't completely
								unreadable.

					<p>This report was requested for staff to track the increase of a 
						specific data point (clients) that were being duplicated in their 
						database due to errors in the data ingested. They wanted to see how 
						fast the duplicates were growing, how quickly they were being removed 
						(merged), and which teams were removing them (this has been blocked out 
						for privacy). 
						This team did not want any filters in the report as they wanted a static file.
						<br>
						
					</p>

					<p>
						The tables needed for this report were quite large, 
						with some over 2 million rows. I opted for transforming and 
						joining the data in Tableau and caching an extract which 
						refreshed weekly. Six database tables were joined to get all the counts needed. 
						Also appended to the removed/merged client count was an excel file with 
						recently manually 
						reviewed duplicate client accounts that were not reflected in the database.

								<p>A recent side user experience project 
									has been organizing the many Tableau
									dashboards hoarded on a team's local drive with a Tableau-esque
									table of contents with links to frequently used reports.
									The goal is to organize them by topic and navigate around using just
									one dashboard that I keep on hand.
								</p>
								<p>To have a linked path between content areas and reports, everything
									will first need to be published into Tableau Server. Permissions will be set for
									only the teams who require access.

							<p>An issue we faced at work was our database accepting duplicate client records, 
								with the duplicates being scattered among several versions of a name or address. 
								For example, we may have a Jane Doe and Jane Doe, both with a 3/2/65 date of birth 
								and matching birth certificate ID, but one has the address 1234 Apple Ave and 
								the other has the address 1234 Apple Ave Apt 103. Separately, we may have a Jane Doe and a Jaine doe
								also with matching identifying information.
