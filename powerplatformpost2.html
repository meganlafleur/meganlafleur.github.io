	<p>
		This team completed a yearly enrollment process where all client information was updated and approved. The existing process was to pull an Excel file of clients and email it to 12+ team members to work through. The Excel sheet would be manually consolidated and then sent out each day to continue processing. 

		
	<p>
		To replace the manual Excel file, we opted for a flow that looped through the Excel file each morning. New rows created a new SharePoint list item and existing rows updated the item.

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pp2_flow1.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>
	<p>
		If the client ID matches, or is not equal to 0, then it prompts an update. If the match is equal to 0, then it creates a new item.

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pp2_flow2.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>

	<p>
		Once the list is updated, team members assign items as needed to process them. We decided to leave this as a manual process because it was dependent largely on who was working that day and had bandwidth, etc.
		Though the assignment happens in the SharePoint list, it may also be a future switch to have it occur in the app instead. The team is accustomed to the list now, so the process continues to function with the list only being accessible
		to the team leads for the assignment.
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/list1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	</p>

	<p>
		The rest of the process continues in Power Apps. When users open the power app to process enrollments, the OnStart property stores their User().Email value as a variable.
		All sites assigned to the user are shown in a gallery on their homepage. If the SharePoint list reviewer column has their email, then it appears as a pending item.

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/re2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/re3.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>

	<p>
		Users select organizations from the gallery to make edits and approve. From the edit page, users can make notes, change the status, and email the org's points-of-contact for more information.

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/re4.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>

	<p>
		After edits are made, the user hits submit. On select of submit, the item is placed into two collections, one of completed orgs for the day and one of total completed orgs. 

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/re5.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>

	<p>
		Why two collections? After submitting and returning to the home page, we can see the org submitted was moved to the reviewed section on the right. In the middle, it shows that we now only have 2 orgs to review. On the left, the completed org is also reflected in the "Re-enrollments reviewed today" count, as well as the "Total re-enrollments reviewed" count. The count from today shows us the number of orgs completed only today (one). The total orgs shows us the number of orgs the user has completed total during re-enrollment (2, in this case). We wanted a way to track both daily and total progress, so two collections worked best. The other requirement was that we needed a way to clear out today's completed enrollments collection.
		Some organizations make changes to their submission and will update on the list the next day. If the user had already moved them to completed status, then they would appear completed the next day too, even though they re-submitted their enrollment and need to be reviewed again.

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/re6.png" alt="" /></span></div>

	</p>

	<p>
		After resetting, the enrollments reviewed today resets. The total, however, remains the same -- so the user still gets credit for reviewing.
		

		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/re7.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	</p>

	<p>
		We also wanted the user to get credit for approved orgs, so the "My approvals" count on the left looks through the SharePoint list and counts the approved orgs assigned to the current user. 
		We see here that it counts the two approvals seen in the gallery.
		<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/re8.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	</p>

	<p>
		Last, but not least, the team needed a way to visually track progress 
		for leadership. Tableau was not an ideal option because the SharePoint connector wasn't 
		allowable in the organization. 
		So, Power BI -- but most of the leadership team did not have Power
		BI licenses.
		
	
	</p>

	<p>
		Plan C -- build out the report in Power BI and spit it out as a PDF 
		(usually the preferred format anyway).
		
		After connecting the SharePoint list to a report and building out visuals, the report
		was published in Power BI service. We set up a subscription to email a PDF of the report each week. 
		We then built a Power Automate flow to trigger whenever the email report was received, grab the PDF, and email it
		all the necessary people with the attachment. It also included a link to the report for
		those that did have the right licenses.
